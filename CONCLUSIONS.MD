**Bower** is good and simple. I like That. Not mandatory but I think I will use it in my next project. It allows you 
to extract libraries files from your repository and manage versioning and upgrades with simplicity. Unfortunately it 
force you to reference your libraries explicitly. 

**Bootstrap** is more robust and customizable than before. Bootstrap v1 did not convince me but I may succumb to 
bootstrap v3. Much thoroughness in this v3. I need now to experiment with a real project. I like the generic and 
utility components of bootstrap. Good starting point. 

**Angular** is a strange thing. I was totally against it at first. I'm very suspiscious in general with black box 
frameworks or tools. I'm more of a Backbone guy. It is true that learning angular is not a [straight path](http://www.google.fr/url?source=imglanding&ct=img&q=http://www.bennadel.com/resources/uploads/2013/feelings_about_angularjs_over_time.png&sa=X&ei=E89UVdjrEoS0UdvPgJAI&ved=0CAkQ8wc&usg=AFQjCNG_h7OAtthWp-Ed2JWUk1kcGYppbQ). 
There are ups and downs. I could have ease my curve by accepting not to understand everything at first. When you are a 
freak control, sometimes you have to take a leap of faith. I don't like everything in angular, and clearly they are 
still searching themselves. But i'm starting to think that it is an interesting framework. Development time seems to be 
quite reduced and some concepts are really good and promising. As always, I need to test it on a big project with real life 
constraints. 

I'm truly convinced by **Karma** and **Protractor**.
